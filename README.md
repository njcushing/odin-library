# odin-library

A Library project created as part of The Odin Project's 'JavaScript' course.

In the browser, you can create a new book using the 'Add New Book' button, which will open a form where you can input the title, author, number of pages and check a box depending on whether you've read the book or not. Adding the book will then automatically update the DOM and append your new book element to the existing ones.

You can them mark a book as 'read' or 'not read', the result of which will be the appearance of that book's card being slightly altered in addition to the text indicating whether or not you've read the book. You can also remove books from your library by clicking the appropriate button at the bottom of each book's card.
